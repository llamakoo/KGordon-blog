description: >
  Neural rendering is a new class of deep image and video generation approaches
  that enable explicit or implicit control of scene properties such as illumination,
  camera parameters, pose, geometry, appearance, and semantic structure.
  It combines generative machine learning techniques with physical knowledge from computer graphics
  to obtain controllable and photo-realistic outputs.
